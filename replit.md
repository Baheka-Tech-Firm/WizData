# WizData Platform

## Overview
A comprehensive data platform for financial and ESG data aggregation, processing, and API services. Built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL.

## Project Architecture
- Flask web application with SQLAlchemy ORM
- PostgreSQL database for data storage
- Modular API routes for different data services
- Real-time data streaming with WebSocket support
- Data ingestion from multiple sources (JSE, crypto, forex, ESG)
- AI-powered insights and analysis tools

## Recent Changes
- **2025-07-30**: Successfully completed migration from Replit Agent to Replit environment
- **2025-07-30**: Restructured Flask app with application factory pattern (app.py)
- **2025-07-30**: Fixed circular import issues by separating models and routes
- **2025-07-30**: Made all external API integrations optional with graceful fallbacks
- **2025-07-30**: PostgreSQL database successfully connected and models working
- **2025-07-30**: All API routes, blueprints, and core functionality verified working

## User Preferences
- Microservices architecture for scalability and fault isolation
- Event-driven data ingestion with message queues
- Data lake support for raw archives and auditability
- Scheduled job management with proper retry mechanisms
- TimescaleDB optimizations for performance
- Environment-based configuration management
- API rate limiting and caching layers
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability

## Architecture Enhancement Roadmap
Based on user requirements, the following enhancements are planned:

### 1. Modular Microservices Architecture
- Break monolith into: data-ingestion-service, data-cleaning-service, indicator-engine, api-gateway, auth-service
- Benefits: Better scalability, fault isolation, team collaboration

### 2. Message Queue Implementation (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
- Event-driven architecture for real-time data ingestion
- Asynchronous processing with backpressure and retry support

### 3. Data Lake Integration (S3/MinIO)
- Raw data archival for auditability and reprocessing
- Historical analysis and model backtesting capabilities

### 4. Scheduled Job Management (Temporal/BullMQ)
- Centralized time-based job scheduling
- Retry mechanisms and failure tracking

### 5. TimescaleDB Enhancements
- Continuous aggregates for performance
- Data compression policies for cost reduction

### 6. Infrastructure Improvements
- Environment-based configuration management
- API rate limiting and Redis caching
- Monitoring with Grafana + Prometheus + Loki
