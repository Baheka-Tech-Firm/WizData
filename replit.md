# WizData Platform

## Overview
A comprehensive data platform for financial and ESG data aggregation, processing, and API services. Built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL.

## Project Architecture
- Flask web application with SQLAlchemy ORM
- PostgreSQL database for data storage
- Modular API routes for different data services
- Real-time data streaming with WebSocket support
- **Intelligent Scraper Microservices**: Modular per-source scrapers with Playwright/Scrapy integration
- **Queue-Based Data Pipeline**: Message queue processing with Kafka fallback to in-memory
- **Proxy & Anti-Detection**: Residential proxy rotation with stealth browsing techniques
- **Quality Assurance Pipeline**: Schema validation, outlier detection, and data integrity checks
- **Orchestrated Job Scheduling**: Intelligent scheduling with retry mechanisms and SLA monitoring
- AI-powered insights and analysis tools

- **2025-07-30**: Implemented Phase 1 microservices infrastructure:
  - Environment-based configuration management (12-Factor compliance)
  - Redis-based rate limiting and caching middleware
  - Prometheus metrics and structured logging
  - API status and monitoring endpoints
  - Microservices setup script with Docker/K8s templates

## User Preferences
- Microservices architecture for scalability and fault isolation
- Event-driven data ingestion with message queues
- Data lake support for raw archives and auditability
- Scheduled job management with proper retry mechanisms
- TimescaleDB optimizations for performance
- Environment-based configuration management
- API rate limiting and caching layers
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability

## Architecture Enhancement Roadmap
Based on user requirements, the following enhancements are planned:

### 1. Modular Microservices Architecture
- Break monolith into: data-ingestion-service, data-cleaning-service, indicator-engine, api-gateway, auth-service
- Benefits: Better scalability, fault isolation, team collaboration

### 2. Message Queue Implementation (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
- Event-driven architecture for real-time data ingestion
- Asynchronous processing with backpressure and retry support

### 3. Data Lake Integration (S3/MinIO)
- Raw data archival for auditability and reprocessing
- Historical analysis and model backtesting capabilities

### 4. Scheduled Job Management (Temporal/BullMQ)
- Centralized time-based job scheduling
- Retry mechanisms and failure tracking

### 5. TimescaleDB Enhancements
- Continuous aggregates for performance
- Data compression policies for cost reduction

### 6. Infrastructure Improvements
- Environment-based configuration management
- API rate limiting and Redis caching
- Monitoring with Grafana + Prometheus + Loki
