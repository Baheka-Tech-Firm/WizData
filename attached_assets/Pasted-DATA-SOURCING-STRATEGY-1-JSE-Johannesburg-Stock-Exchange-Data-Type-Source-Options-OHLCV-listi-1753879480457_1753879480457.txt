DATA SOURCING STRATEGY
🔹 1. JSE (Johannesburg Stock Exchange)

Dividends, earnings, metadata	JSE SENS Announcements ⬩ ProfileData ⬩ Company websites

✅ Recommended: Start with scraping + Alpha Vantage fallback → move to licensed JSE data once you gain traction.

🔹 2. Cryptocurrency
Data Type	Source
OHLCV, tickers	CoinGecko (free), CoinMarketCap, Binance API
Order book	Binance WebSocket, Kraken API

🔹 3. Forex
Source	Features
Alpha Vantage (free)	5-minute delay, basic indicators
Open Exchange Rates	Real-time (paid)
TrueFX / OANDA	Real-time quotes, order book

✅ Use Alpha Vantage for MVP, upgrade to TrueFX or OANDA when monetizing.

🔹 4. Financial News
Source	Type
NewsAPI.org (free/paid)	Headlines, global
Google News RSS + scraping	Custom source tagging
SENS Announcements (JSE news)	Corporate filings
RSS for Business Day, Fin24	South Africa specific

🔹 5. Fundamentals & Analytics
Data Type	Source
Ratios, EPS, debt	Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Finbox API
Screener data	Finviz (US only), custom compute from your DB
AI sentiment	Your own NLP model on top of news headlines

🧱 SYSTEM STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OTHER PRODUCTS
🔁 1. Centralized Data Engine (WizData)
Make WizData your core data warehouse + API hub. All other products (VueOn, Wealth, Pulse, Trader, etc.) will consume WizData via API.

📦 2. Modular Data Services in WizData
Split into services:

market-data-service

indicator-engine

event-engine (dividends, earnings, splits)

metadata-service

screener-engine

news-service

Each product only calls what it needs.

🧠 3. Use a Message Queue (Kafka)
To broadcast updates (price ticks, news) from WizData to all apps:

VueOn receives real-time chart data

Pulse gets a summary feed

Connect (client portal) gets news alerts

🛡️ 4. API Gateway & Auth Layer
Use an API gateway to:

Rate-limit per product

Manage API keys & scopes (e.g., VueOn can’t access Pulse-specific endpoints)

Centralize monitoring and usage metrics

🔌 PLUGGABLE PRODUCT INTEGRATION
Product	Consumes from WizData
VueOn (Charts)	OHLCV + Indicators + Events
Trader (Strada)	Quotes + Order Book + Screener + News
Pulse (Market Overview)	Aggregated metrics + Sector performance
Wealth (Novia)	Company profiles + fundamentals + earnings
Connect	News feed + insights + alerts

✅ TL;DR: ACTION PLAN
🔨 Build WizData Core
PostgreSQL (for metadata, fundamentals)

TimescaleDB (for OHLCV + tick data)

Redis (for real-time cache)

S3/MinIO (for raw HTML/PDF/news archives)

📡 Plug in Scrapers / APIs
Build source-specific modules (JSE, Crypto, FX, News)

Normalize & push into WizData

🔐 Expose APIs
REST + GraphQL + optional WebSocket

Swagger / Postman for internal devs

📎 Connect to All Products
Document all endpoints

Use feature flags/scopes for product-specific access
