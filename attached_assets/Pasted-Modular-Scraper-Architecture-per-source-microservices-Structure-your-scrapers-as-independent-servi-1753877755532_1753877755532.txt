Modular Scraper Architecture (per-source microservices)
Structure your scrapers as independent services:

diff
Copy
Edit
- scraper-jse
- scraper-bloomberg
- scraper-sars
- scraper-coingecko
- scraper-news
Each service should:

Fetch ‚Üí Parse ‚Üí Normalize ‚Üí Push to message queue

Be stateless, retryable, and containerized (Docker)

Tech stack:

Scraping: Playwright or Puppeteer (JS) or Scrapy (Python)

Headless browsers (for dynamic sites)

Rotate proxies, user-agents, and headers

Log everything (errors, latency, changes)

üß† 2. Intelligent Scheduling and Prioritization
Use a job orchestrator like:

Temporal, Apache Airflow, or BullMQ

Why:

Control frequency based on data type (e.g., JSE prices every 5s, company filings daily)

Retry failed scrapes with backoff

Log execution metrics for SLA monitoring

üîÅ 3. Queue-Based Processing with Kafka or RabbitMQ
Flow:

Scraper pushes raw data to Kafka topic: raw.jse.quotes

Normalizer consumes raw ‚Üí outputs to clean.jse.quotes

Indicator service consumes clean ‚Üí enriches to enriched.jse.quotes

Why:

Scalable

Supports parallel processing

Enables multiple consumers (ML models, APIs, dashboards)

üõ°Ô∏è 4. Proxy & Anti-Ban Infrastructure
‚úÖ Rotate:
Residential proxies (SmartProxy, BrightData, Oxylabs)

User-Agents + Referrers

IP pools via AWS, Azure regions

‚úÖ Other strategies:
Headless stealth: puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth

Captcha solvers: 2Captcha, AntiCaptcha

Rate-aware scraping: match site‚Äôs update schedule

üîç 5. Quality Assurance Pipeline
Build a QA layer after scraping:

Schema validation (e.g., all prices must have ISO timestamp, currency)

Outlier detection (e.g., price jumps >50% flagged)

Cross-source verification (JSE vs Bloomberg for BHP.AX)

Store logs in ELK stack (Elastic + Logstash + Kibana) for human QA.

üì¶ 6. Structured Storage & Indexing
Use:

TimescaleDB for time-series price data

PostgreSQL/Clickhouse for structured meta (e.g., company profiles)

MinIO/S3 for document/file dumps (PDFs, filings)

Redis for short-term cache (for APIs)

üßæ 7. Compliance and Legality
Scrape only public data or via open APIs

Respect robots.txt (unless a client waives that through B2B)

For sensitive/gray-area data, proxy scrapers through partner jurisdictions

Keep terms-of-service logs per source for audit protection

üß± 8. Deploy, Monitor, Scale
Run scrapers on Kubernetes (autoscale based on job queue size)

Use Prometheus + Grafana to monitor:

Success rates

Latency

Proxy usage

Store failed runs and requeue intelligently

üß† Bonus: Make It a Product
UI for custom scrape configs

Let users request ‚Äúscrape this site daily‚Äù (like Diffbot, Import.io)

Scheduled exports: JSON, CSV, Excel, or feed to their system via webhook
