To pick your niche, we want a vertical that:

Has data scarcity (hard to find, messy, or unstructured)

Serves a growing industry (with funding and demand)

Has multiple buyers (startups, corporates, NGOs, researchers)

Fits your existing tech/data strengths

Can be monetized via APIs, dashboards, or reports

✅ Top Niche Vertical Recommendation: African ESG + Infrastructure Data
Why It’s Powerful:
Africa is ignored by global ESG data firms

ESG is required for funding, compliance, reporting

Infrastructure (roads, electricity, water) drives investment decisions, public policy, and insurance models

You can pull data from government, satellite, and news sources and layer your own AI + NLP processing

How would I get all this data?
ChatGPT said:
To build WizData ESG Africa™ and deliver powerful ESG + infrastructure data, you’ll need to aggregate and normalize public, open, and semi-structured datasets across South Africa. Here’s exactly where and how to get each type of data for your MVP:

1️⃣ Environmental Data
A. Electricity Access & Load Shedding
Source	Method
Eskom SePush API	Live load shedding stages (via community API)
Stats SA	Electrification stats (CSV downloads)
Open Africa / Eskom CSVs	Infrastructure projects, electrified households
NER (National Energy Regulator)	Reports on energy per municipality (PDF/CSV)
Tools: Scrape or automate CSV import → normalize per region

2️⃣ Social Data
A. Education Metrics
Metric	Source
Schools per region	Department of Basic Education EMIS database
Literacy rates	Stats SA Community Survey, DHS surveys
Teacher/student ratio	Education budget reports, annual stats
B. Healthcare Access
Metric	Source
Clinic locations	OpenStreetMap, Dept of Health facility registry
Hospitals per district	Health GIS portal, Stats SA
Vaccination & outreach data	WHO + NICD reports
Tools:

Use geojson from OpenStreetMap to map health and school facility points

Join with region polygons from Stats SA shapefiles

3️⃣ Governance Data
A. Municipal Audit Outcomes
